# Email Response Draft for SportsDataIO

**Subject:** Re: SportsDataIO Integration Inquiry - Product Overview

Hi Ewan,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm happy to provide some context on our project.

**Business Needs:**

We're building a sports analytics platform that helps users make more informed decisions around sports betting. Our primary focus is currently on **college basketball (NCAA)**, with plans to expand to other major sports leagues (NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB) as we scale.

The data will be used by our internal platform to power analytics and recommendations for end users. We're exploring opportunities to eventually expose some of this data through programmatic interfaces (MCP servers and NLWeb) for agent-based access, which would involve microtransaction-based usage models.

**What We're Building:**

We're in the **live product stage** with an active user base. Our platform combines betting odds data with comprehensive team statistics and advanced analytics to provide matchup insights, predictions, and betting recommendations.

**Specific Data Types We Need:**

- **Historical team statistics** (season averages, recent form, head-to-head records)
- **Live game data** (scores, in-game statistics, play-by-play where available)
- **Team and player information** (rosters, schedules, standings)
- **Projections and advanced metrics** (if available through your platform)

We're particularly interested in reliable, real-time data feeds that can support our analytics engine, as well as historical data for trend analysis and model training.

**Success Criteria:**

Our key outcomes include:
- Maintaining high data accuracy and reliability for our users
- Supporting real-time updates for live games
- Ensuring scalability as we expand to additional sports
- Building a foundation for future programmatic access models

I'd be happy to discuss our specific technical requirements and explore how SportsDataIO's offerings align with our needs. Would you be available for a brief call to discuss integration options and pricing?

Thanks again for your interest.

Best regards,
Ben
